In this project, I will use machine learninig to teach a program to extract the keywords of an article. To accomplish this, I am using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), a statistic that compares the frequency of words in one article to their prevalence in other pieces. A word that is common in an individual article, but not in most others will provide us with specific information about the piece. On the flip side, the more common a word is across articles, the less informative it is for any one piece. For instance, the word “country” will be prevalent in most articles related to politics. However, the word “India” will only be prevalent in articles discussing the country. As a keyword, “country” does not tell us much about what the article is about, whereas “India” tells us that the article will discuss India. < /br>
