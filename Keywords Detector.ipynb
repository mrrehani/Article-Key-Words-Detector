In other words, the IDF weight for each term is calculated by taking the log of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents where the term is present.

The keywords tell us who the article is about and references prominent talking points from the article. However, the 5th keyword, \"bit\" is not very descriptive, as it does not play a large role in the article. It was likely chosen due to it's large IDF value.
